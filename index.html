            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Jaeger Studios was established in February of 2023 under the name of Just Three Guys.
                We started as a Roblox development group with the goal of creating a tower defense game better than Tower Defense Simulator.
                Our first project was Sparring Battlefields, a tower defense game, which has now been renamed to Infernal Tower Defense.
                It has gone through many stages, and wasn't worked on a lot at one point.
                During the down time, we got into Minecraft modding and UE5 coding.
                Once we found some people willing to help, we renamed the studio and the game.
                Infernal Tower Defense was back in the works and the game concept started to come together.
                From that moment Jaeger Studios started the goal of creating quality games and mods.
